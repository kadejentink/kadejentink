- My name is Kade Jentink, and I'm currently a doctoral student studying cognitive neuroscience. Primarily, I focus on fMRI, although I also have experience in EEG.
- I've spent time with several different programming languages, including Matlab, Python, R, and the bash command line. My favorite is definitely Python, though. 
- These are primarily the scripts I use for my dissertation work.  

- Check me out on LinkedIn, or contact me directly at: kade.jentink@gmail.com
